# Nios V FPGA Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will create and customize a soft processor with **Nios** (an embedded system with a processor and peripherals), embed it in the FPGA, and write code to control LEDs.

## Getting Started

To follow this tutorial, you will need:

- **Hardware**: DE10-Standard and DE0-CV
- **Software**: Quartus 23.1std (23.1.1) or later and Ashling RiscFree IDE
- **OS**: Windows
- **Documents**:
  - [DE10-Standard_User_manual.pdf](./pdfs/DE10-Standard_User_manual.pdf)

## RISC

**Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC)** is a computer architecture based on the concept of simplifying instructions so that each performs only one function at a time. This model has the opposite idea of CISC(Complex Instruction Set Computer) which has a large set of complex instructions which makes it extremely versatile. RISC design aims to increase the speed of individual instructions by enabling the use of an instruction pipeline, allowing multiple instructions to be processed simultaneously at different stages of execution. By focusing on a smaller set of simple instructions, RISC reduces complexity and increases performance efficiency. Furthermore, most instructions are designed to execute in a single clock cycle, especially in pipelined architectures.


## RISC-V

**RISC-V** is an open and free instruction set architecture (ISA) based on RISC principles, designed for simplicity, flexibility, and scalability. Its modular design includes a minimal base instruction set with optional extensions, enabling customization for a wide range of applications, from embedded systems to high-performance computing. Unlike proprietary ISAs, RISC-V is open-source, fostering innovation and reducing development costs.

## Nios-V

**Nios-V** is a soft processor provided by Intel and integrated into Quartus. Based on a RISC-V architecture, Nios V supports the addition of custom instructions implemented in HDL. This makes it highly customizable.

## Setting Up the Tools

To get started with the project, you‚Äôll need to download and install a few essential tools. These include **Quartus 23.1std (or later)** and the **Ashling RiscFree IDE**, which will be used to compile and run the project, respectively.

### Step 1: Download

If Quartus is not yet installed on your system, begin by downloading the necessary files from the [Intel Website](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software-kit/825278/intel-quartus-prime-lite-edition-design-software-version-23-1-1-for-windows.html). Ensure you download the following files:

- **Quartus Download**: ![Quartus Download](./imgs/Quartus_download.png)
- **Cyclone V Download**: ![Cyclone V Download](./imgs/Cyclonev_Download.png)
- **Ashling RiscFree IDE Download**: ![Ashling RiscFree IDE Download](./imgs/Aishling_Download.png)

Once downloaded, place all files in the same folder, as shown below:

- **Image of files grouped together**: ![Grouped Files](./imgs/Quartus_Build.png)

Now, run the `QuartusSetup.exe` file to initiate the installation process.

If Quartus is already installed, you should only download the **Ashling RiscFree IDE** and run the RiscFree executable to set it up as an external tool.

### Step 2: Downloading the License

Intel requires a license to use the Nios V IP in Quartus Prime Lite Edition. This license is essential to proceed with this project. Follow the instructions in the [License Nios V Guide](https://www.macnica.co.jp/en/business/semiconductor/articles/intel/140701/) to obtain the necessary license.

**Notes:**
- For this project, we will use the **Nios V/m IP**. Make sure to download this specific license.
- The license is valid for a period of one year and will expire afterward. You will need to renew it if you plan to continue using the Nios V IP beyond this period.


### Step 3: Setting up the License

Once you receive the `.dat` license file via email, download it and place it in the `flexlm` folder located in the root directory (e.g., `C:\flexlm`). If this folder does not exist, create it.

To configure Quartus to recognize the license, go to **Tools > License Setup** as shown in the image below:

![License Setup Menu](./imgs/License_path.png)

In the License Setup window, add the path to the `.dat` file in the **License File** field. After completing these steps, your setup should resemble the following:

![License File Configuration](./imgs/License_Setup.png)

With everything now set up, you‚Äôre ready to begin working on the project.

## DE10-Standard

This tutorial references both the [Tutorial FPGA RTL](https://insper.github.io/Embarcados-Avancados/Tutorial-FPGA-RTL/) and [Tutorial FPGA NIOS](https://insper.github.io/Embarcados-Avancados/Tutorial-FPGA-NIOS/). It‚Äôs recommended to go through these tutorials first, as they cover essential concepts like project creation, the Pin Planner, Platform Designer, and more.


### Step 1: Creating The Project

In Quartus: **File ‚û°Ô∏è New Project Wizard**

1. **Directory, Name, Top-Level Entity**
   - Choose the destination as your repository.
   - Name the project as `niosv`.

2. **Project Type**
   - Select **Empty Project**.

3. **Add Files**
   - We won't add any files for now.

4. **Family, Device & Board Settings**
   - Look for the FPGA settings:
     - **Family**: Cyclone V
     - **Name**: 5CSXFC6D6F31C6

     ![License File Configuration](./imgs/Project_DE10_settings.png)

5. üÜó **Finalize the Wizard**

---


### Step 2: Adding the Toplevel

First we need to create our toplevel and define our signals. In this project we will use a clock signal as Input and six LEDs as Output. 

To add a new file to the project, follow these steps:

1. Go to **File ‚û°Ô∏è New** or press `CTRL + N`.
2. Select **VHDL File**.
3. Save the file by navigating to **File ‚û°Ô∏è Save As**.
   - Name the file as `Nios_V_RTL.vhd`.
4. üÜó Confirm to save the file.

Open the `Nios_V_RTL.vhd` file you created and add the following template code. This will serve as a starting point, allowing us to assign signals later on:

```vhdl
library IEEE;
use IEEE.std_logic_1164.all;

entity Nios_V_RTL is
    port (
        fpga_clk_50   : in  std_logic;
        fpga_led_pio  : out std_logic_vector(5 downto 0)
    );
end entity Nios_V_RTL;

architecture rtl of Nios_V_RTL is

begin

end rtl;
```

Right click the file and set it up as the Top Level Entity:

1. **Project ‚û°Ô∏è Set as Top-Level Entity**

---

### Step3: Assigning the I/Os

First, compile the project by running **Analysis & Synthesis** so that the Pin Planner can automatically recognize the I/Os, eliminating the need to set names manually.

1. Click on **Processing ‚û°Ô∏è Start ‚û°Ô∏è Start Analysis & Synthesis** or press `CTRL + K`.

To edit the pin assignments:

1. Go to **Assignments ‚û°Ô∏è Pin Planner**.

According to the [DE10-Standard User Manual](./pdfs/DE10-Standard_User_manual.pdf), your pin assignments should resemble the following configuration:

![Pin Configuration](./imgs/Pins_DE10.png)

Furthermore, you need to add a new file to the project that outlines the boundary conditions of the project for the tool, so that the clock is properly assigned.

To create a new constraints file, follow these steps:

1. Go to **File ‚û°Ô∏è New File ‚û°Ô∏è Synopsys Design Constraints File**.
2. Save the file as:

   ```plaintext
   Nios_V_RTL.sdc
    ```
3. File Template:
    ```plaintext
   # 50MHz board input clock
    create_clock -period 20 [get_ports fpga_clk_50]

    # Automatically apply a generate clock on the output of phase-locked loops (PLLs) 
    derive_pll_clocks

    ```

Lastly, click on **Processing ‚û°Ô∏è Start Compilation** or `CTRL + L` to compile the project so that the changes are applied. After compiling, you should observe that there are no longer any critical errors in the project.

### Step5: Compiling the Project    

To compile the project, complete the following steps:

1. **Add the `niosv.qip` file to the project**:
    - Click on **Project ‚û°Ô∏è Add/Remove Files in Project...**  
      ![Add/Remove Files](./imgs/Add2.png)
    - Click on **Add ‚û°Ô∏è Add the `.qip` file ‚û°Ô∏è Apply**.  
      ![Add QIP File](./imgs/Add.png)

2. **Add the NIOS-V to the `Nios_V_RTL.vhd` file**

    ```vhdl
    library IEEE;
    use IEEE.std_logic_1164.all;

    entity Nios_V_RTL is
        port (
            -- Gloabals
            fpga_clk_50   : in  std_logic;
            fpga_led_pio  : out std_logic_vector(5 downto 0)
    );
    end entity Nios_V_RTL;

    architecture rtl of Nios_V_RTL is

    component niosv is
            port (
                clk_clk       : in std_logic := 'X';
                reset_reset_n : in std_logic := 'X';
                    leds_export   : out std_logic_vector(5 downto 0)
            );
    end component niosv;

    begin

    u0 : component niosv
            port map (
                clk_clk       => fpga_clk_50,
                reset_reset_n => '1' ,
                leds_export   => fpga_led_pio
                    
            );

    end rtl;
    ```

3. **Compiling**:
    - Click on **Start Compilation** or press `CTRL+L`.  
      ![Compile](./imgs/Compile.png)
    - After the compilation is done, click on **Program Device (Open Programmer)** in the task window.  
      ![Compile2](./imgs/Compile2.png)
    - Set the device as taught in tutorial 1 and click on **Start**.
    ![Compile2](./imgs/Compile3.png)

Now that Nios-V is set on the FPGA, we can proceed to programming the software.

### Step6: Setting Up the Software

The **Board Support Package (BSP)** is a collection of software libraries and configuration files that provide the interface between the operating system or application software and the specific hardware of a system. It enables the software to correctly interact with the peripherals and functionalities defined in the hardware design.

To set up the BSP and software, complete the following steps:
1. **Opening the Shell**:
    - Open the `niosv-shell.exe` located at `intelFPGA_lite/23.1std/niosv/bin`.

    ![Shell](./imgs/Shell1.png)
    - Navigate to the project directory,

2. **Create the BSP**:
    - Run the following command:
        ```bash
        niosv-bsp -c -t=hal --sopcinfo=niosv.sopcinfo software/bsp/settings.bsp
        ```
    - **Explanation**:
        - **`niosv-bsp`**: This is the command to create a Board Support Package (BSP) for Nios V.
        - **`-c`**: Indicates that the BSP configuration will be created or updated.
        - **`-t=hal`**: Specifies the type of BSP as HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer).
        - **`--sopcinfo=niosv.sopcinfo`**: Points to the `.sopcinfo` file, which describes the hardware system configuration.
        - **`software/bsp/settings.bsp`**: The location and name for the BSP settings file that will be generated.

    - This command ensures that a **Nios V BSP of type HAL** is created based on the hardware description provided in the `.sopcinfo` file, and it will be stored at the specified path: `software/bsp/settings.bsp`.

    - The response below should be shown after creating the BSP, and a software directory should be created at the root of the project containing the directory bsp and the file settings.bsp.

    ![Shell](./imgs/Shell2.png)

3. **Create the App**:
    - Create a new folder inside `/software` named `app`.
    - In the new folder, create a `.c` file named `leds.c`.
    - Run the following command:    
        ```bash
        niosv-app -a=software/app -b=software/bsp -s=software/app/leds.c
        ```
    - **Explanation**:
        - **`niosv-app`**: This command is used to create a Nios V application.
        - **`-a=software/app`**: Specifies the application directory. Here, it points to `software/app`, where the application files are stored.
        - **`-b=software/bsp`**: Specifies the path to the BSP configuration directory created earlier.
        - **`-s=software/app/leds.c`**: Specifies the main source file for the application, in this case, `leds.c`.

    - This ensures that a new application is correctly linked with the previously created BSP, and the application files are initialized in the specified directory.

    - The response below should be shown after creating the application:

        ```bash
        2024.11.28.05:31:11 Info: "software\app\CMakeLists.txt" was generated.
        ```

    - This indicates that the application setup is complete and the necessary build files (`CMakeLists.txt`) have been successfully generated in the specified directory.

---

### Step7: Programming the Software

#### Ashling RiscFree IDE
[RiscFree IDE](https://www.ashling.com/ashling-riscfree/) is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) based on Eclipse, developed by Ashling to support the development of embedded applications for the RISC-V architecture. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools and features for software developers working with RISC-V-based processors and systems.

To program the software, complete the following steps:

1. **Open RiscFree IDE**
    - Type `riscfree` in the niosv-shell.
    - Select the **software** folder as the workspace path and click **Launch**.

2. **Creating the Project**
    - Click on **Create a project...**  
      ![Create a project](./imgs/Free.png)
    - Select **C/C++ ‚û°Ô∏è C Project**.  
      ![Select C Project](./imgs/Free2.png)
    - In the next step:
        - Select **CMake driven ‚û°Ô∏è Empty Project**.
        - Uncheck **Use default location**.
        - Set the **app** folder as the location and name the project **app**.  
          ![Project Configuration](./imgs/Free3.png)
    - Finally, click **Finish** to create the project.

3. **Write the LED Code**
    - Open the **app** folder and click on `leds.c`, then write the following code:

    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include "system.h"
    #include <alt_types.h>
    #include <io.h> // For Avalon read/write

    void delay(int n) {
        volatile unsigned int delay = 0;
        while (delay < n) {
            delay++;
        }
    }

    int main(void) {
        unsigned int led = 0;

        printf("Embarcados++ \n");

        while (1) {
            if (led < PIO_0_DATA_WIDTH) { // Use defined data width of the PIO
                IOWR_32DIRECT(PIO_0_BASE, 0, 0x01 << led++);
                usleep(50000); // 50ms delay
            } else {
                led = 0;
            }
        }

        return 0;
    }
    ```

    - **Explanation**:
        - Initializes an LED counter (`led`) and prints "Embarcados++" to the console.
        - In the `while (1)` loop:
        - Shifts a bit left through the LEDs connected to the PIO, lighting them sequentially.
        - Uses `IOWR_32DIRECT` to write to the Avalon interface, controlling the LEDs.
        - Delays for 50ms using `usleep(50000)`.
        - Resets the counter (`led`) when it reaches the width of the PIO.

    This code makes the LEDs connected to the PIO blink sequentially in a loop, demonstrating basic hardware control using the Avalon memory-mapped interface.

4. **Build Project**
    - Right-click on the **app** folder and select **Build Project**.  
      ![Build a project](./imgs/Free4.png)

    - **Expected Console Output**:  
      In case of success, the console should display a message similar to the following:  
      ```text
      05:54:13 Buildscript generation finished (took 11216 ms)
      ```

5. **Connect the Juart**

The **JUART (JTAG UART)** is a hardware peripheral commonly used in FPGA designs for serial communication. It provides a simple way to transmit and receive data between an embedded system (like a Nios II or Nios V processor) and a host computer through a **JTAG (Joint Test Action Group)** interface.

- There are two ways to connect the Juart:

    1. **Connect via `niosv-shell`**:
        - Open a terminal and type:
            ```bash
            juart-terminal
            ```

    2. **Set up the Juart in the IDE**:
        - Navigate to **Run ‚û°Ô∏è External Tools ‚û°Ô∏è External Tools Configurations**.
        - Double-click on **Program** to create a new configuration.
        - Use the following settings:
            - **Location**:  
                ```text
                intelFPGA_lite/23.1std/quartus/bin64/juart-terminal.exe
                ```
            - **Arguments**:  
                ```text
                -c 1 -d 0 -i 0
                 ```
            - Click **Apply** to save the configuration.
